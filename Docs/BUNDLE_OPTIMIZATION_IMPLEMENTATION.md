# Bundle Optimization Implementation

This document outlines the specific optimizations made to reduce bundle size and
improve loading performance in the MedCosta Frontend application.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting with Dynamic Imports

-  **Page-level Code Splitting**: All page components are now lazy-loaded using
   React's `lazy()` and `Suspense`.

   -  The main routing file (`Routing.jsx`) now imports pages dynamically
   -  Each route loads its content only when needed

-  **Component-level Code Splitting**: Form steps within the Patient
   Registration are lazy-loaded

   -  Each step is loaded only when needed, improving initial page load time

-  **Utilities for Lazy Loading**: Created reusable utilities in `lazy-load.jsx`
   -  `lazyLoad()` - For default exports
   -  `lazyLoadNamed()` - For named exports

### 2. Manual Chunk Configuration

-  **Vendor Chunking**: Third-party libraries are now grouped into logical
   chunks via `rollupOptions.output.manualChunks`
   -  React and routing libraries in 'react-vendor'
   -  Radix UI components in 'radix-ui'
   -  Calendar and date libraries in 'calendar'
   -  Data table libraries in 'tables'
   -  Visual and animation libraries in 'ui-effects'
   -  Utility libraries in 'utils'

### 3. Loading Experience Improvements

-  **Loading Indicators**: Added appropriate loading states throughout the
   application

   -  Global loading spinner during initial app load
   -  Page-specific loading indicators during route transitions

-  **Route Prefetching**: Implemented background prefetching of frequently
   accessed routes

   -  Common routes are loaded in the background after authentication
   -  Reduces perceived latency when navigating between pages

-  **Error Handling**: Added global error boundary for handling chunk loading
   failures

### 4. Build Analysis Tools

-  Added `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for bundle analysis
-  New npm scripts for analyzing bundles:
   -  `npm run build:analyze` - Build with visualizer
   -  `npm run analyze` - Open the visualization report

## Results

-  **Reduced Initial Load Size**: The initial JavaScript payload is smaller
-  **Improved Caching**: Better chunking allows for more efficient browser
   caching
-  **Better Performance**: Loading only what's needed when it's needed
-  **Enhanced User Experience**: Loading indicators provide feedback during
   transitions

## Next Steps

Consider these additional optimizations:

1. **Preload Critical CSS**: Extract and inline critical CSS
2. **Image Optimization**: Implement responsive images and next-gen formats
3. **Tree-shaking Review**: Analyze imports for unused code
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add real user monitoring
